I kept my momma up late
On her knees as she prayed for her boy
Who was hanging on by a thread
I was acting a fool
I was skipping on school
Getting high as a kite, gonna wind up dead
She believed I'd return like the prodigal
Pray to God every day for a miracle
No, I'm not a lost cause, she wouldn't give up on me
And I
I never would have made it
I never would have made it
Without you, you, you
And I
I never would have made it
I never would have made it through
Without you, you, you
I was coming home late
Covering every state
In a van with a band barely getting paid
And the love of my life
She was up through the night
With the kids fighting tears hoping for a break
By my side with a love unconditional
Had the faith to believe for a miracle
No, I'm not a lost cause, she wouldn't give up on me
And I
I never would have made it
I never would have made it
Without you, you, you
And I
I never would have made it
I never would have made it through
Without you, you, you (Without you)
Tell me where, tell me where would I be
Tell me where would I be without you
If you hadn't been praying for me and standing by me
Tell me, oh-oh-oh-ohh
Tell me where, tell me where would I be
Tell me where would I be without you
If you hadn't been praying for me and standing by me
I'd be lost without you, without you
And I (I-I)
I never would have made it (I never would have made it)
I never would have made it
Without you, you, you (Without you, without you)
And I (I-I-I)
I never would have made it (I never would have made it)
I never would have made it through
Without you, you, you (Without you, without you)
