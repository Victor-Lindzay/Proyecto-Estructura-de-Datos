In the blink of an eye
Life flashed
Right in front of my eyes
Never knew that the fear
Could cripple my chest
In the blink of an eye
The light left
So lonely it is
So lonely tonight is
And I wish I knew why
Yeah, I wish I knew why
I need You more
Yeah, I need you more
More than ever before
Yeah, I need you more
Prepare for the worst
Hope for the best
Won't you steady my heart
For whatever comes next?
So holy it is
So holy tonight is
Oh, now I know I
Now I know I
I need You more
Yeah, I need you more
More than ever before
Yeah, I need you more
Yeah, I need You more
Yeah, I need you more
More than ever before
Yeah, I need you more
Just a little closer, a little clearer
Our souls are nearer tonight
Just a little sweeter, a little deeper
Our souls are nearer tonight
Just a little closer, a little clearer
Our souls are nearer tonight
And just a little sweeter, a little deeper
Our souls are nearer tonight
I need You more
Yeah, I need you more
More than ever before
Oh, I need, I need you, I need you more
