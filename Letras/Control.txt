You asked me to let go but I thought I knew better
Afraid of surrender and what I don't know
I've always had a plan but now I'm so weary
And I can't see clearly, forgot who I am

So won't You make my eyes Your eyes
My ears Your ears, my tears Your tears
And won't you make my hands Your hands
My feet Your feet, my dreams Your dreams

I give up control, oh, oh whoa
Body, mind, and soul, oh, oh whoa
Can't do this on my own, no, no
I give up control

Can I speak honestly? I've still got some questions
Still fightin' attention, I need some relief
No, I'm no Superman, this is my confession
Been learnin' my lesson, help me understand

So won't You make my eyes Your eyes
My ears Your ears, my tears Your tears
And won't you make my hands Your hands
My feet Your feet, my dreams Your dreams

I give up control, oh, oh whoa
Body, mind, and soul, oh, oh whoa
Can't do this on my own, no, no
I give up control

I will raise my voice and sing
I will, I will raise my voice and sing
It's all I've got left to bring
I will, I will raise my voice and sing
I will raise my voice and sing
I will, I will raise my voice and sing, yeah
It's all I've got left to bring
I will, I will raise my voice and sing

I give up control
I give up control, oh, oh whoa
Body, mind, and soul, oh, oh whoa
Can't do this on my own, no, no
I give up control
Oh, give up control, oh, oh whoa
My body, mind, and soul, oh, oh whoa
I can't do this on my own, no, no
I give up control

Oh, I give up control
(Ooh)
(Ooh)
