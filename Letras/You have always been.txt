I've had good days, I've had bad days, tasted victory in defeat
I've had problems, biggest planets turn to pebbles when You speak
I've had nothing to my name, never lacked for anything
Because You were there with me
You've been my Savior, Sustainer, when I'm at my end
My Healer, Redeemer, again and again
My Mother and my Father, Brother, Sister, and Friend
Everything I've needed Lord, You've always been
Everything I've needed Lord, You've always been
When I stand before You guilty, oh, Your mercy bears my blame
When in pride I think I'm worthy, You point out the price You paid
When I wander far away, You keep calling my name
You don't give up on me
You've been my Savior, Sustainer, when I'm at my end
My Healer, Redeemer, again and again
My Mother and my Father, Brother, Sister, and Friend
Everything I've needed Lord, You've always been
Everything I've needed Lord, You've always been
You are my strength, my rock, Jesus
You are my hope, my song, Jesus
Before my heart knows what to pray
You've already made a way, Je-eee-sus
You've been my Savior, Sustainer, when I'm at my end
My Healer, Redeemer, again and again
My Mother and my Father, Brother, Sister, and Friend
Everything I've needed Lord, You've always been
You've been my Savior, Sustainer, when I'm at my end
My Healer, Redeemer, again and again
My Mother and my Father, Brother, Sister, and Friend
Everything I've needed Lord, You've always been
Everything I've needed Lord, You've always been
Everything I've needed Lord, You've always been
Oh, Yes, You have
Thank You, Jesus, yes
You've always been
